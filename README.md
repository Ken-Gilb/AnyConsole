# AnyConsole
A CSharp library that gives you better console handling for that classic ASCII look.

## Description

AnyConsole was designed for server service windows, utility tooling and log output windows. It's very handy if you need static header/footers on your consoles while maintaining scrollable areas, adding visual components or more advanced input management such as mouse control. It integrates very well with TopShelf for services.
